# Getting and Cleaning Data: Code Book

This code book explains the content of the files generated by the run_analysis() function, averages.csv and dataset.csv

### dataset.csv
This file containes the merged, filtered, and cleaned-up training and test datasets. Its fileds are:
- "MeanAccelerationX" the mean body acceleration over a 1/50s interval, taken from the accelerometer, X-Axis
- "MeanAccelerationY" id., Y-Axis
- "MeanAccelerationZ" id., Z-Axis
- "StdAccelerationX" the standard deviation of the body acceleration given previously, X-Axis
- "StdAccelerationY" id., Y-Axis
- "StdAccelerationZ" id., Z-Axis
- "MeanGravityAccelerationX" the gravity component corresponding to the body acceleration given previously, X-Axis
- "MeanGravityAccelerationY" id., Y-Axis
- "MeanGravityAccelerationZ" id., Z-Axis
- "StdGravityAccelerationX" the standard deviation of the gravity component given previously, X-Axis
- "StdGravityAccelerationY" id., Y-Axis
- "StdGravityAccelerationZ" id., Z-Axis
- "MeanAngularVelocityX" the mean angular velocity over a 1/50s interval, taken from the gyroscope, X-Axis
- "MeanAngularVelocityY" id., Y-Axis
- "MeanAngularVelocityZ" id., Z-Axis
- "StdAngularVelocityX" the standard deviation of the angular velocity given previously, X-Axis
- "StdAngularVelocityY" id., Y-Axis
- "StdAngularVelocityZ" id., Z-Axis
- "Activity" the activity being performed at the time of the measurement. 
- "Subject" the person on which the measurements were bein done (numeric identifier)

The measurements were taken from the accelerometer and gyroscope, then filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. The acceleration signal was split into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

The Activity can be any of
- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING

### averages.csv
This files contains the mean of the calues found in dataset.csv:
- "Activity" the activity being performed at the time of the measurement. 
- "Subject" the person on which the measurements were bein done (numeric identifier)
- "MeanAccelerationX" the mean body acceleration for a given person and activity
- "MeanAccelerationY" id., Y-Axis
- "MeanAccelerationZ" id., Z-Axis
- "StdAccelerationX" the mean standard deviation of the body acceleration for a given person and activity, X-Axis
- "StdAccelerationY" id., Y-Axis
- "StdAccelerationZ" id., Z-Axis
- "MeanGravityAccelerationX" the mean gravity component for a given person and activity, corresponding to the body acceleration given previously, X-Axis
- "MeanGravityAccelerationY" id., Y-Axis
- "MeanGravityAccelerationZ" id., Z-Axis
- "StdGravityAccelerationX" the average standard deviation of the gravity component given previously, X-Axis
- "StdGravityAccelerationY" id., Y-Axis
- "StdGravityAccelerationZ" id., Z-Axis
- "MeanAngularVelocityX" the mean angular velocity for a given person and activity, X-Axis
- "MeanAngularVelocityY" id., Y-Axis
- "MeanAngularVelocityZ" id., Z-Axis
- "StdAngularVelocityX" the mean standard deviation of the angular velocity given previously, X-Axis
- "StdAngularVelocityY" id., Y-Axis
- "StdAngularVelocityZ" id., Z-Axis

Since all the measurement in dataset.csv were done for the same time interval, the results of the "mean of means" is the mean over the whole measurement period.
